"""UI module for Mrs. Salesforce agent - extracted from app.py for modularity."""
# This file contains the UI logic for Mrs. Salesforce
# It's imported by the main app.py when the user selects Mrs. Salesforce

# The full UI is in src/app.py - we'll import it directly
# This file is a placeholder for future modularization
